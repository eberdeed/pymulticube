    multicube.py is a program that displays a number of 
    cubes randomly distributed and rotated.  The display 
    has a number of keys enabled.
    The keys are as follows.
    a right
    s back
    d left
    w forward
    r up
    f down
    x reverse view.
    z reset view.
    Escape ends the program.
    Alt+Return sets full screen.
    Up arrow zooms in.
    Down arrow zooms out.
    
    To run the program you will need python 3.4 and the following libraries:
    PyOpenGL, PIL, numpy, sfml, and GLM. For the documenation I use epydoc.
    
    The installation command is:
    
    sudo chmod +x multicube.py
    sudo ./setup.py install
    
    To run a program use:
    
    multicube.py
    
    
    The documentation is located in:
    
    /usr/share/doc/multicube-doc
    
    The sources I used to educate myself concerning OpenGL are
    as follows:
        "OpenGL ES 3.0 Programming Guide Second Edition" 
    by Dan Ginsburg and Budirijanto Purnomo published by Addison-Wesley 2014.
        www.learnopengl.com.
    For python I used David Lutz' books from Oreilly Press.
    
    All of the software used is available at:
    www.pypi.org
    epydoc:  http://epydoc.sourceforge.net
    The program was written on debian linux available at:  www.debian.org.
